        <h1>Objective</h1>
        To solve technical challenges that provide me the opportunity to expand my current 
        knowledge of technologies, and to work with other talented individuals.
        
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        I pride myself in writing and testing clear, resilient source code that is easy for others 
        to understand, re-use and extend, and also enjoy building automation to repetitive tasks. I 
        am a self-motivated individual capable of self-education and subsequent instruction of 
        others.
