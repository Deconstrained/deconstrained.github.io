Resumé of Demitri Morgan

Built using this awesome JSON-based resume generator: 
[prat0318/json_resume](https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume)

A new version based on XML/XSLT/HTML5/CSS3 that is 100% my own work and not
based on any third-party generator is currently in progress.

## TODO ##
Going to http://deconstrained.github.io/resume.xml generates an HTML page that
passes the hello world test... Now all we need is to build out the XML
Stylesheet to take the resumé data and generate a good looking page.

* Create SASS compile script + add stylesheet to GenericTech.xsl
* Choose some classy fonts
* Make some nify monochrome icons, create a sprite, and add them to the header
  (like we currently have with json\_resume)
* CSS for personal header, skills, experience, etc.
* Structure for the rest of it!
